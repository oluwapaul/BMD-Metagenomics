Project title: In-feed bacitracin methylene disalicylate alters microbiota function and increases antibiotic resistance in a dose-dependent manner. 

The study analyzed the effect of in-feed bacitracin methylene disalicylate at suththerapeutic and therapeutic dose on cecal metagenome of turkey over a 78 days period.

This will give an overview the scripts
The scrips are arranged in the following other:
1. Quality filtering and assembly.txt - for quality filtering and annotattion
2. TIGR_Annot.sh - for TIGRfam annotation
3. TIGR2gff.py
4. TIGR_countmerge.R
5. TIGRfam_annotatioMerge.R
6. Fig1.txt - input files from TIGRfam_annotatioMerge.R and TIGR_countmerge.R
7. Fig2 and SFig3,4,5.txt - input file produced by script from Fig1.txt
8. Fig3 and SFig2 - input file provided in data folder
9. Fig4 and SFig1.txt - input file from Quality filtering and assembly.txt
10. Fig5 and SFig6,7.txt - input file provided in data folder
11. Fig6 and 7.txt - input file from Quality filtering and assembly.txt
12. Fig8 and SFig8-12.txt - input files from Fig6 and 7.txt and is also provided in data folder
