Project title: In-feed bacitracin methylene disalicylate alters microbiota function and increases antibiotic resistance in a dose-dependent manner. 

The study analyzed the effect of in-feed bacitracin methylene disalicylate at suththerapeutic and therapeutic dose on cecal metagenome of turkey over a 78 days period.

This will give an overview the scripts
The scrips are arranged in the following other:
1. Quality filtering and assembly.txt - for quality filtering and annotattion
2. TIGR_Annot.sh - for TIGRfam annotation
3. TIGR2gff.py
4. TIGR_countmerge.R
5. TIGRfam_annotatioMerge.R
6. Fig1.R - input files from TIGRfam_annotatioMerge.R and TIGR_countmerge.R
7. Fig2_Fig1-3.R - input file produced by script from Fig1.R
8. Fig3-4.R - input file from Quality filtering and assembly.txt
9. Fig5_FigS4-5.R - input file provided in data folder
10. Fig6_FigS6-10.R - input files from Fig3-4.R and is also provided in data folder
11. Fig7_Fig11.R - input file provided in data folder
12. Fig8_Fig12.R - input file from Quality filtering and assembly.txt
